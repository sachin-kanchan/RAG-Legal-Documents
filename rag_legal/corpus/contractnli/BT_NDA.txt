In the absence of the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, the Receiving Party shall not produce nor disclose the Confidential Information, or any part thereof, to any third party.
2.2 Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Confidential Information is proprietary information and for the exclusive and non-transferable use of the persons to whom it is addressed and the recipients of the Confidential Information agree that all of the information contained herein is of a confidential nature and is subject to this Confidentiality Agreement, and that they will not, directly, or indirectly, disclose or permit their agents or affiliates to disclose any such information without the prior written consent of Transnet except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
2.3 Return of Confidential Information. Promptly following the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will deliver to the Disclosing Party all confidential information (and copies and extracts thereof) furnished to, or created by or on behalf of, the Receiving Party.

The Receiving Party expressly agrees, therefore, that the Disclosing Party, in addition to any rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent the breach, or the further breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees to reimburse the Disclosing Party for any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, opportunity costs, and direct or indirect expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees, profit opportunity returns foregone and any court costs) incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of any prima facie breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.
