1. PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT
The Parties to this Agreement desire to engage in discussions regarding present and/or potential future business relationships. This Agreement combines a non-disclosure, a non-circumvention, non-solicitation and non-competition agreement. The Parties intend to engage in substantive discussions and sharing of confidential information regarding certain new and useful business opportunities, business contacts, trade secrets, business entity formation and structuring.
In connection with these discussions, it may be necessary and/or desirable for the Parties to provide the other with, or allow access to, proprietary, technical, or business data, and/or other confidential information (collectively the "Confidential Information"). Therefore, the Parties hereby agree that they are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.
The Parties both believe, and hereby agree, that Confidential Information has significant commercial value that would be diminished by unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, the commitments of confidentiality in this Agreement are a condition to the Parties’ willingness to engage in the contemplated business discussions and planning.
The Parties agree that they shall not use any advantages derivable from such information in its own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement with all other signatories to this document. Each signing party shall be held responsible and liable in case of a breach of this Agreement both in a professional and personal capacity.
2. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Confidential Information shall be defined as any information specifically identified as “Confidential” prior to disclosure to the other Party. This identification shall be by way of formal correspondence (letter, fax or email) addressed to the other Party outlining the proposed information to be disclosed (without giving specific details), requesting the receiving Party to recognise this as Confidential Information and therefore being bound by this Agreement. The receiving Party has the right to accept the information under this Agreement or to decline the information in which case it will not be provided.
3. OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY
The Parties agree that when receipt of any Confidential Information has occurred:
3a. The receiving Party shall not disclose or communicate Confidential Information to any third party, except as herein provided. The receiving Party shall protect such information from disclosure by reasonable means, including but not limited to at least the same minimal level of security that the receiving Party uses for its most crucial proprietary and trade secret information.
3b. The receiving Party shall reasonably protect the Confidential Information with not less than the same degree of care exercised by its own personnel to protect its own, or publication of its own, most valuable confidential and proprietary information.
4. OBLIGATION OF NON-COMPETITION
The non-competition provisions of this Agreement are an essential and material part of the total agreement, by which the Parties agree they shall not use any advantages derivable from such confidential information in their own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement executed by all signatories to this document.
5. NON-CIRCUMVENTION
The Parties hereby agree on behalf of themselves, their officers, directors, agents, associates and any related parties, that they will not, directly or indirectly, contact, deal with or otherwise become involved with any entity or any other entities or parties introduced, directly or indirectly, by or through the other party, its officers, directors, agents or associates, for the purpose of avoiding the payment to the other Party of profits, fees or other amounts, without the specific written approval of the other Party.
6. NO REPRESENTATIONS
The Parties both understand that each Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information it provides. The Parties both agree that neither Party, nor any of its advisers, representatives, agents, or employees shall be held liable for utilization of Confidential Information which results from the other Party’s use of said information.
