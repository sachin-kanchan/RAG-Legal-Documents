Recipient has had or will have directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents of Recipient to whom Confidential Information is disclosed or who have access to Confidential Information sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in content substantially similar to this Agreement and will promptly notify the Discloser in writing of the names of each such person who has signed such agreements after such agreements are signed. Recipient agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized hereunder to have any such information, which measures shall include the highest degree of care that Recipient utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Recipient agrees to notify the Discloser in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of such Confidential Information which may come to its attention.
4. Mandatory Disclosure. In the event that the Recipient or its directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents are requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall give prompt notice so that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.

7. Term. The foregoing commitments shall survive any termination of discussions between the parties, and shall continue for a period of three (3) years following the date of this Agreement.
