As used in this Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of Boston Private and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private, (ii) any tender offer (including a self tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving Boston Private or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of Boston Private.
